# 🧾 CLI Expense Tracker (Python)

A modular **command-line based Expense Tracker** built using Python.  
This project allows users to manage daily expenses with full **CRUD operations**, while storing data persistently in a CSV file.

The application is designed with a clean folder structure, separating features, utilities, and data handling logic.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

# Project Structure

## ⚠️ Important Note About `data/` Folder

- The `data/` folder and `expenses.csv` file are **automatically generated**
- They are created **only when the user saves an expense**
- This folder is **not included in the repository** intentionally
- The project works without this folder initially

This approach keeps the repository clean and avoids committing generated data.
